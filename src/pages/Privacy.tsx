              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                We collect this personal data because you provided this data to us. For example, you may provide personal data when entering into a contract or agreement with us, by entering your data on our website or by giving us your business card. We may also collect your personal data from other sources, such as counterparties we do business with, the Trade Register or by using publicly available sources.

              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Virida Capital Management may process your personal data where we need it for a specific purpose. We set out in the table below the ways in which we plan to use your personal information. We are only able to use your personal information if we have a proper legal reason or basis for doing so. This is called a legal basis and the regulations require that we have a legal basis so that your privacy is protected.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">Most commonly we will use your information in the following ways:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">

                <li>We have a contract with the company you represent and have a legitimate interest to process your information. For example, we manage a fund for which you act as a representative and need to process your personal data to conclude and execute the agreement and manage the investments on behalf of the company</li>
                <li>We have a legal obligation. We need to use your personal information to comply with laws that assist in the prevention of financial crime and to comply with regulatory obligations. For example this might include confirming your identity and source of wealth, as well as ensuring we provide you with necessary information so you understand the risk of the financial services we can provide.</li>
                <li>We receive your consent: for example in the case you agree to receive newsletters from us.</li>
                <li>We, or a third party, have a legitimate interest in processing the information and your interests and fundamental right do not override those interests. For example, processing your information to source deals.</li>

                As a fund manager Virida Capital Management will typically have a contract with you and will need to keep your personal information (updated to ensure accuracy) to fulfil our contract. We also need to comply with EU and Dutch law, which often requires us to keep certain records – which will include certain personal information – for several years.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                In general, we shall keep personal data related to any contracts with you or the company you represent and investments during the lifecycle of the contract or Investment and for 7 years after termination thereof.

              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Our policy is to keep records on prospective investors, management teams and other business contacts for a period of 5 years after our last contact or sooner if you inform us that we may no longer store your personal data for these purposes.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                We may wish to contact long standing contacts about a particularly relevant opportunity in the future, and in the context of venture capital and private equity business there is no way to predict when such an opportunity might arise.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                We will ensure all records are safely destroyed if we no longer need to retain them. We review our retention periods for personal information on a regular basis. We will tell you if we change the retention period.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                The aforementioned retention periods may be extended in the event that this is necessary in order to safeguard our legal position or to defend our rights, e.g. in the event of a legal dispute or where necessary to determine, defend or exercise our legal rights and position.
