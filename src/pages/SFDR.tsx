                1 Sustainability risk policies (Article 3 SFDR)
              </h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                In accordance with Art. 2 (22) SFDR a "sustainability risk" is defined as an environmental, social, or governance event or condition that, if it occurs, could cause an actual or a potential material negative impact on the value of the investment.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Responsible investment and environment, social, and governance (ESG) integration are core to VIRIDA's investment strategy. VIRIDA aims to take sustainability risks into account before any investment decision is made. Currently, sustainability risks are integrated in the investment decision process as part of the standard due diligence and risk assessment processes. This ensures that they are incorporated into the assessment and recommendation provided to the investment committee. Our commitment to acknowledging these risks is expressed in our ESG Investment Policy.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                VIRIDA uses its best effort to take into account the "minimum safeguards" that are:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li>UN Sustainable Development Goals ("UN SDGs"): alignment with at least one UN SDG, as examples, SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action)</li>
                <li>UN Global Compact principles on Human Rights, Labor, Environment, and anti-corruption;</li>
                <li>UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; and</li>
                <li>OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Furthermore, VIRIDA follows the guidelines set by its internal policies:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li>ESG Investment Policy</li>
                <li>Conflict of Interest Policy</li>
                <li>Anti-Money Laundering Policy</li>
                <li>Whistleblower Policy</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                VIRIDA understands the value and importance of investing in companies that have a positive impact. As such, sustainability risks are taken into account while VIRIDA seeks to invest in companies that are not only financially healthy, but will also directly contribute to the energy transition while avoiding harm to direct stakeholders, society, and the environment.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                In its free discretion, VIRIDA may decide to make an investment even if sustainability risks have been determined. In such cases, VIRIDA will apply appropriate mitigation measures to manage its investment.

                2 No consideration of adverse impacts of investment decisions on sustainability factors (Article 4 SFDR)
              </h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                VIRIDA does not consider principal adverse impacts of its investment decisions on sustainability factors within the meaning of Art. 4 SFDR and, hence, does not use the sustainability indicators listed in Annex I of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 to identify and assess potential adverse impacts.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Principal adverse impacts according to the SFDR are the most significant negative impacts of investment decisions on sustainability factors relating to environmental, social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                VIRIDA will invest in early-stage companies with typically small teams and will typically hold minority stakes in such companies. Considering PAIs would require the Manager to report according to a set list of indicators for which there are currently no sufficient data available. Until there is more practical guidance with regard to applying the detailed provisions on principal adverse impacts with insufficient data, the Manager will regularly review the possibility to consider principal adverse impacts.

                As a sub-threshold manager as defined in Article 2:66a Dutch Act on financial supervision (Wet op het financieel toezicht), acting as a manager of a qualifying venture capital fund as defined in Art. 3 (c) of Regulation (EU) No 345/2013 ("EuVECA-Regulation"), VIRIDA does not have and does not need to have a remuneration guideline or policy.

                VIRIDA conducts due diligence for financial, legal and commercial, intellectual property, technical, as well as ESG matters.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                ESG considerations are integrated in VIRIDA's due diligence process as per the following. The processes are outlined in VIRIDA's Risk Policy and ESG Investment Policy and consider:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li>Screening for ESG risks during initial due diligence</li>
                <li>Discussion of any ESG risks at all investment committee meetings</li>
                <li>ESG considerations as one of the key investment metrics</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                In addition to this, positive and negative screening criteria are used during the due diligence phase. As many of the portfolio companies in which the Fund will invest will not have developed ESG strategies nor have impact measurement KPIs readily available, the due diligence process also considers the maturity stage of the portfolio company, and the steps needed for ESG data gathering and ESG process development at portfolio company level. Regular follow-ups are scheduled with the portfolio company and at the (management) board level.

                k) Engagement Policies
              </h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Engagement is the active and purposeful process of dialogue with portfolio companies where VIRIDA is seeking to improve portfolio company's business practices, especially in relation to the management of ESG issues.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                VIRIDA maintains regular engagement with its portfolio companies through voting rights, monitoring and dialogue. This translates into continuous interaction with founders and senior management of the portfolio companies.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                ESG topics are part of these discussions. Should an ESG issue arise at portfolio company level, the Fund's Investment Committee will determine how to best continue engagement (for example through more regular dialogue or more frequent monitoring) until the issue has been resolved.
